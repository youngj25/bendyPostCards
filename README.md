# bendyPostCards

Which application you choose to develop and why?
The purpose of this web application will be to develop a Postcard Creator that will allow users to upload/take pictures and add text, then afterwards emailing the postcard to a specificed person.

Quality is important. It would be better to select an simpler project and develop a high quality product, than to choose a more challenging project and sumbit it with normal/average functionality.

Within the first 2-3 days I was able to successfully send out Postcards from the web application through my Gmail. Which allowed me to send the remainder of the two weeks styling the page with Bootstrap, developing new tools, restructing the web application to make the UI/UX a nice and easy flow. 


How to use/test the provided application
The application can be used/tested by downloading the repository, unzipping the folder. If you already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can simply go to the "Node.js command prompt" or search for it in your start menu. If not here is a link to go to the Node.js site and download the needed resource. After Node.js is downloaded. Simply maneuver to where you downloaded the repository by using 'cd' and then the folder name. Once you reach the folder destination, go into and then type the following text into the Node.js command prompt, "node server_Postal".

This will start the application. After which, go onto any of web browsers at your dispoal and type "localhost:9000" into the web browsers address bar. 


What Operating System (+ service pack) and libraries are required



Any design decisions or behavioral clarifications that illustrate how you program functions and why

The initial plans were for the user to enter an email address and password, then for the server to validate/send a test email to the specificed email address prior to letting the user access the Post Card creator. However, after developing the web application, it became apparent that this idea was flawed and it would be best to leave the web application itself easily acessible, then when the user wants to send the postcard have them input the following information. However, the user will still have to provide a working email address and password to get access to an email postcard history.

What tools/libraries(and versions) are necessary to use and test your application
  - Node.js/Express.js
    - It is more convenient working with one language, Javascript, on both the Server and Client side. For that reason, Node.js/Express.js was chosen.
